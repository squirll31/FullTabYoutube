# Switch To YouTube Embed

**Switch from the standard desktop YouTube page to the full-tab embed player.**

A really simple button that navigates from a standard YouTube page to the embedded version of the page.

## Install

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switch-to-youtube-embed/fcojgiahffnnpifmgaboijdmkgedikhb)

## Why?

This gives you a resizable version of the YouTube player by accesing it through the enmbed URL. The embedded view of a video takes up the entire tab but isn't fullscreen so you can interact with it like any other Chrome window or tab.

## What does it do?

It parses the URL of the current tab and constructs a URL to the embedded view. It then makes the current tab navigate to that URL. It's nothing fancy.
